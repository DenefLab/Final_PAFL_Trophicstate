### Set the Working Directory  
###  Within the "Final_PAFL_Trophicstate" directory there should be the following 2 sub-directories:
        #   1.  "raw_data":  includes 5 files:  taxonomy table, OTU (shared) table, "metadata", "duplicate_metadata.txt", "AllLakes_depthprofile.csv" 
        #   2.  "alpha_data":  includes 2 files:  "InvSimpson100" and "ObservedRichness100"  (These files are made between lines 261-295 and take ~20 minutes to calculate.  These files are added for reviewer convenience.)
setwd("~/Final_PAFL_Trophicstate")

### Source written functions in the file Functions_PAFL.R that is housed within the "Final_PAFL_Trophicstate"
source("Functions_PAFL.R")
